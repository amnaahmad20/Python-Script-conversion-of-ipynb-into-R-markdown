# Python-Script-conversion-of-ipynb-into-R-markdown
After running the conversion script, the output R Markdown (.Rmd) file will be saved to the location you specify in the output_file variable of the script.
##Ensure Jupytext is Installed: Make sure you have jupytext installed, as it's the primary tool used here. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:
bash
Copy code
*pip install jupytext*

**Adjust File Paths** Replace your_notebook.ipynb with the path to your actual Jupyter notebook and specify where you want the R Markdown file to be saved.
**Run the Script** Execute this Python script in your environment. It will read the IPYNB file, convert it to an R Markdown format, and save it as specified.
